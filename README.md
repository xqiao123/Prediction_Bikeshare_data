# Prediction_Bikeshare_data

## Abstract
The purpose of this report is to find out the factors that influence people’s choice of casual bike rentals and registered bike rentals by establishing two models, and through the interpretation of the model and the context of the problem, we explore the variables that lead to the difference between the two kinds of bicycle rental demand. Finally, we make recommendations based on some important variables, such as hr, day and holiday, and identify two groups of people who select the two types of bike rentals. 

## Introduction
In order to improve bicycle-sharing system and reduce environmental pollution, traffic jams and other problems, we want to better understand the factors that affect people’s choice of the subscribed/unsubscribed bike rentals, so we decided to write the report to analyze the variables that may affect the demands of casual bike rentals and registered bike rentals.

The dataset we collected includes 752 observations and 11 variables, including casual, registered, season, hr, day, holiday, weather, temp (temperature), feelslike (‘feels like’ temperature), hum (humidity) and windspeed. From these variables, I suggest that hr, day, holiday may be the main factors influencing different bike rental demands based on the context.
